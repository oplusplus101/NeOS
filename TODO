Make exceptions inside a driver not crash the entire kernel
Redo the boot process (comlpete overhaul of the 1st and possibly remove the 2nd stage bootloader, redo the drive abstraction, add a better way of finding the main partition)
Add a neater way of making driver-to-kernel calls (Completely redo the kernel-driver interface)
Add the build process of the drivers and libraries to CMakeLists.txt
Fix process killing in the scheduler
Rewrite/clean up the UEFI bootloader (Change UNIX types to Microsoft, make PE32+ code more efficient)
Implement Dynamic Linked Libraries (DLLs) 
Add a basic MS-DOS-like shell
Clean up AHCI code
Add support for multiple drives (AHCI)
Document the whole codebase with comments
Find a way to build the disk image without root
Implement a neater way of dealing with paths
Implement NVMe reading for the bootloader
Implement a Windows-like registry
Change the current filesystem (FAT-32) to a custom one
Move all platform-specific code (GDT, IDT, TSS, etc.) over to a HAL-like interface
Make a user system - with a root user and admin, standard, and guest users -- and also add groups so that different users can access the same file
Move NEOSLDR.SYS to the main drive (Make the EFI bootloader directly read the main filesystem)
Make an installer (a program that sets up the file system, copies in all important files, and creates a default user)
Add support for multiple languages in the kernel
