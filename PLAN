Create a basic 64-bit OS with the following features:
- UEFI bootloader;
- A kernel that handles: users, the filesystem, memory, and loading drivers and modules;
- A DWM-like GUI;
- An NTFS or EXT4 filesystem;
- Use the PE64 format for executables;
- A bash-like shell.
Drivers:
A driver handles communication between modules and the hardware.
Modules:
A module is a generic interface between drivers and user-mode programs. Modules can also be used as kernel extensions.

The boot process:
- The bootloader loads the kernel located at: \NEOSKRNL.SYS in the ESP
- The kernel will load the files: C:/SYS/DRV.CFG, and C:/SYS/MOD.SYS. These files say which drivers/modules to load.
- Once the drivers/modules are loaded, the kernel will run the file C:/SYS/AUTOEXEC.SH
